        <h2>Not your typical tea business</h2>
        <p>Today's typical tea experience is an unappealing teabag served in a small tin pitcher.  If you're lucky, you might be offered a selection of finer teas from a wooden chest.  You certainly won't be offered more hot water.  The mission of American Tea Experience, by RT Enterprises of NY, is to help people discover better-tasting, healthier teas offered in the way nature and their cultures of origin intended them to be.</p>
        <p>We do this by connecting the thousands of specialty tea merchants (farmers, blenders, importers, educators) to restaurants, retail outlets and hospitality venues to offer their customers a "custom" tea experience.   The connection is guided by a certified tea expert in North America.</p>
        <p>American Tea Experience was the initial idea of Antoinette Forth, founder and company mentor.  She is assisted in this effort by Yu Ju Chen and Zachary Janish, two students from UB and Sincere Lincoln all of whom she met at the Start-up Buffalo Weekend.  Sincere Lincoln is the technology advisor. Donald Snyder II is the development and funding advisor.</p>
        <p>The company's website was constructed with specifications collected during the International Institute of Business Analysts (Buffalo Chapter) Hackathon - the team won first place in the hackathon.  The site was programmed by GDI Buffalo - Girls Develop It Hackathon in February 2015.  </p>
        <p>We would like to thank all of the people who gave so graciously of their time to make American Tea Experience a reality.</p>
